## About

This serves as the back-end of a simple web application that can allow a user to login and manipulate a visual representation of a user database table. These actions include: adding, editing and deleting a user.

The purpose of this project is to gain an insight into the Java spring boot framework and back-end web app development in general. It will also serve as a foundation for similar projects I might pursue in the future.
